This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project experiements with number of react concepts that I wanted to investigate in more details. There experiments help me better understand React. The choice of what to explore is based on my personal interest/needs.


## Table of Contents

The following concepts were interesting for met explore

- Router: how to automate routes. Here I used Routes.js file to store routes and dynamically render these. The definitions are in routeDef object. 

- Passing html through component using this.props.children spread. This approach can be found in the folder children, route [/children](http://localhost:3000/children)

- Higher Order Component (HOC): wrapping child component into a parent to enhance it. The approach is in the folder hoc, route [/hoc](http://localhost:3000/hoc)

- Composition: passing components into a component in order to dynamically create and destory react components. This aproach is in the folder panel, route [/panel](http://localhost:3000/panel)

- Component Lifecycle Methods: understanding lifecycle hooks/method of react component is essential for building complete applications! The approach is in folder lifecycle, route [/lifecycle](http://localhost:3000/lifecycle)
